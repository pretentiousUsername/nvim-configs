# My *neovim* conifgs

These are the config files and plugins I use for [*neovim*][nvim], my text
editor of choice. Everything in here is completely self contained, since,
thanks to the lack of a `.vim` style config separate from the rest of the
plugins, syntax files, and more, I can easily keep everything in a git
repo.
